# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 - Sogamoso, Colombia

This project was developed during the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 in Sogamoso, Colombia. It aims to provide a practical solution to assist farmers in making informed agricultural decisions.

## Challenge Overview

**Challenge Theme:** Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

Farmers are increasingly confronted with various water-related challenges stemming from unpredictable weather patterns, pests, and diseases. These issues can have a significant impact on crop health, farmer profits, and food security. Depending on their geographical location, many farmers may experience droughts, floods, or even both extreme events within a single season.

Our objective is to design an intuitive tool that empowers farmers to easily explore, analyze, and utilize NASA datasets. This tool aims to help address water-related challenges and enhance farming practices, ultimately supporting sustainable agriculture and food security.
