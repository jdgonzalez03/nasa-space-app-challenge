        Farmers face a multitude of water-related challenges due to unpredictable weather, pests,
        and diseases. These factors heavily impact crop health, farmers' profits, and food security.
        Depending on the geography, farmers may experience droughts or floodsâ€”sometimes both in the
        same season! Our mission is to design a tool that empowers farmers to explore, analyze, and
        utilize NASA data to address these water-related concerns and improve their farming
        practices.

        We are electronic and systems engineering students who, through <strong>CapiPlant</strong>,
        seek to provide a solution by leveraging Earth observation data, with a focus on Colombia,
        an agricultural country. We aim to help farmers make better-informed decisions to enhance
        efficiency in their agricultural practices.

        This project is part of our participation in the
        <strong>NASA App Space Challenge 2024</strong> in Sogamoso. This hackathon provides us with
        the opportunity to collaborate and find innovative solutions to help farmers tackle their
        daily challenges.
